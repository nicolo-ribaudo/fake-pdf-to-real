# (WIP) convert PDF converted to XHTML back to PDF

- Currently tested only on https://toplivo.bg/public/OsSiFiles/GFO-2023.xhtml

TODO:
- The text in the generated PDF needs to be stretched to match the original size
- Add an option to make the text non-transparent

USAGE:
```
node ./bin/fake-pdf-to-real.js <path of the fake PDF> <output path for the PDF>
```
